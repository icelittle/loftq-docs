<section id="basics"><title>Basics</title>
<para>This tool tries to make working with docutils in SCons a little easier.
It provides several toolchains for creating different output formats,
like HTML or LaTeX, from a reST (reStructuredText) input file.
</para>
<section id="install"><title>Install</title>
<para>Installing it, requires you to copy (or, even better: checkout) the contents of the
package's <literal>rest</literal> folder to
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem><para><quote><literal>/path_to_your_project/site_scons/site_tools/rest</literal></quote>, if you need the reST Tool in one project only, or
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para><quote><literal>~/.scons/site_scons/site_tools/rest</literal></quote>, for a system-wide installation under your current login.
</para>
</listitem>

<section id="activation"><title>How to activate</title>
<para>For activating the tool "rest", you have to add its name to the Environment constructor,
like this
</para>
<screen>env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
</screen>
<para>On its startup, the reST tool tries to find an installed version of the <literal>docutils</literal> package by
looking for the command-line tool <literal>rst2html</literal>. So make sure that it is added to your system's environment
<literal>PATH</literal> and can be called directly, without specifying its full path.
</para>
</section>
<section id="requirements"><title>Requirements</title>
<para>For the most basic processing of reST to HTML/LaTeX/ODT, you need to have installed
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem><para>the Python <literal>docutils</literal> package, and optionally
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>the <literal>pygment</literal> module for syntax highlighting in code blocks.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
</section>
<section id="process"><title>Processing documents</title>
<para>Creating a HTML or LaTeX document is very simple and straightforward. Say
</para>
<screen>env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
env.Rst2Html('manual.html', 'manual.rst')
env.Rst2Latex('manual.ltx', 'manual.rst')
</screen>
<para>to get both outputs from your source file <literal>manual.rst</literal>. As a shortcut, you can
give the stem of the filenames alone, like this:
</para>
<screen>env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
env.Rst2Html('manual')
env.Rst2Latex('manual')
</screen>
<para>and get the same result. Target and source lists are also supported:
</para>
<screen>env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
env.Rst2Html(['manual.html','reference.html'], ['manual.rst','reference.rst'])
</screen>
<para>or even
</para>
<screen>env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
env.Rst2Html(['manual','reference'])
</screen>
<important><para>Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify a file extension! The
Tool uses the given names as file stems, and adds the suffixes for target and source files
accordingly.
</para>
</important>
<para>The rules given above are valid for all the Builders <literal>Rst2Html</literal>, <literal>Rst2Latex</literal> 
and <literal>Rst2Odt</literal>. 
</para>
</section>
<section id="builders"><title>All builders</title>
<para>A simple list of all builders currently available:
</para>
<variablelist><varlistentry><term>Rst2Html
</term>
<listitem><para>Single HTML file.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Rst2Latex
</term>
<listitem><para>Outputs a LaTeX file.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Rst2Odt
</term>
<listitem><para>OpenOffice output.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</section>
<section id="more"><title>Need more?</title>
<para>This work is still in a very basic state and hasn't been tested well
with things like variant dirs, yet. 
There will definitely arise the need for
adding features, or a variable. Let us know if you can think of a nice
improvement or have worked on a bugfix/patch with success. Enter your issues at the
Bitbucket bug tracker for the ReST Tool, or write to the User General Discussion
list of SCons at <literal>users@scons.tigris.org</literal>.
