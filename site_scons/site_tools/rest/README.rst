###################
The SCons reST tool
###################

Basics
======
This tool tries to make working with docutils in SCons a little easier.
It provides several toolchains for creating different output formats,
like HTML, PDF or LaTeX, from a reST (reStructuredText) input file.

Prepare
--------

Before we use this external tool for scons, we will have to install tools as below:

* docutils
* texlive-full, for multi language support
* rst2pdf for Rest2PDF support

Install
-------
Installing it, requires you to copy (or, even better: checkout) the contents of the
package's ``rest`` folder to

#. "``/path_to_your_project/site_scons/site_tools/rest``", if you need the reST Tool in one project only, or
#. "``~/.scons/site_scons/site_tools/rest``", for a system-wide installation under your current login.

For more infos about this, please refer to 

* the SCons User's Guide, chap. 19.7 "Where to put your custom Builders and Tools" and
* the SCons Tools Wiki page at `http://scons.org/wiki/ToolsIndex <http://scons.org/wiki/ToolsIndex/>`_.

How to activate
---------------
For activating the tool "rest", you have to add its name to the Environment constructor,
like this

::

    env = Environment(tools=['rest'])


On its startup, the reST tool tries to find an installed version of the ``docutils`` package by
looking for the command-line tool ``rst2html``. So make sure that it is added to your system's environment
``PATH`` and can be called directly, without specifying its full path.


Requirements
------------
For the most basic processing of reST to HTML/LaTeX/ODT, you need to have installed

* the Python ``docutils`` package, and optionally
* the ``pygment`` module for syntax highlighting in code blocks.


Processing documents
====================
Creating a HTML or LaTeX document is very simple and straightforward. Say

::

    env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
    env.Rst2Html('manual.html', 'manual.rst')
    env.Rst2Latex('manual.ltx', 'manual.rst')
    env.Rst2PDF('manual.pdf', 'manual.rst')


to get both outputs from your source file ``manual.rst``. As a shortcut, you can
give the stem of the filenames alone, like this:

::

    env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
    env.Rst2Html('manual')
    env.Rst2Latex('manual')
    env.Rst2PDF('manual')


and get the same result. Target and source lists are also supported:

::

    env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
    env.Rst2Html(['manual.html','reference.html'], ['manual.rst','reference.rst'])


or even

::

    env = Environment(tools=['rest'])
    env.Rst2Html(['manual','reference'])


.. important:: Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify a file extension! The
   Tool uses the given names as file stems, and adds the suffixes for target and source files
   accordingly.

The rules given above are valid for all the Builders ``Rst2Html``, ``Rst2Latex`` , ``Rst2Xetex``, ``Rst2PDF``
and ``Rst2Odt``. 


All builders
============
A simple list of all builders currently available:

Rst2Html:: 
  Single HTML file.
Rst2Latex:: 
  Outputs a LaTeX file.
Rst2Odt:: 
  OpenOffice output.
Rst2PDF::
  Outputs a pdf file using rst2pdf.

Need more?
==========
This work is still in a very basic state and hasn't been tested well
with things like variant dirs, yet. 
There will definitely arise the need for
adding features, or a variable. Let us know if you can think of a nice
improvement or have worked on a bugfix/patch with success. Enter your issues at the
Bitbucket bug tracker for the ReST Tool, or write to the User General Discussion
list of SCons at ``users@scons.tigris.org``.
